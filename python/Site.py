class Site:
    """
    The basic class for a binding site on/in a protein/inclusion. User defines \
    Site with bin coordinates. Multiple symmetric Sites can be combined with \
    Symmetric_Site class. One Site (or Symmetric_Site) across multiple replicas \
    can be combined in Site_Across_Replicas class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of this Site. e.g. "Binding site 1," "Left anterior cleft," or \
        something else descriptive.
    leaflet : int
        If 1, outer leaflet. If 2, inner leaflet.
    temperature : float
        The temperature of your system in K.

    Settable Properties
    -------------------
    bin_coords : list of tuples
        The bins that belong to this site in (r, theta) format. e.g. \
        [(2, 10), (2, 11), (2, 12)] would correspond to the 11th, 12th, and \
        13th theta bins in the 3rd radial bin from the origin. Bin coordinates \
        are zero-indexed by convention.

    Calculated Properties
    ---------------------
    site_counts_histogram : numpy ndarray
        One-dimensional ndarray where the histogrammed ligand bead counts are \
        stored. e.g. [12, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0] would correspond to 12 frames having \
        zero beads in the Site, 5 frames having one bead in the Site, 0 frames \
        having 2, 3, or 5 beads in the site, and 1 frame having 4 beads in the \
        Site.
    bulk_counts_histogram : numpy ndarray
        One-dimensional ndarray where the histogrammed ligand bead counts are \
        stored. e.g. [12, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0] would correspond to 12 frames having \
        zero beads in the bulk patch, 5 frames having one bead in the patch, 0 \
        frames having 2, 3, or 5 beads in the patch, and 1 frame having 4 beads\
        in the patch.
    n_peak : int
        The mode of the bulk histogram. Indicates the cut-off for P_unocc.
    dG : float
        The binding affinity of the lipid for the Site, in kcal/mol.
