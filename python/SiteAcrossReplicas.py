        this Site_Across_Replicas.
    site_counts_histogram : numpy ndarray
        One-dimensional ndarray where the histogrammed ligand bead counts are \
        stored. e.g. [12, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0] would correspond to 12 frames having \
        zero beads in the Site, 5 frames having one bead in the Site, 0 frames \
        having 2, 3, or 5 beads in the site, and 1 frame having 4 beads in the \
        Site.

        One-dimensional ndarray where the histogrammed ligand bead counts are \
        stored. e.g. [12, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0] would correspond to 12 frames having \
        zero beads in the bulk patch, 5 frames having one bead in the patch, 0 \
        frames having 2, 3, or 5 beads in the patch, and 1 frame having 4 beads\
        in the patch.
    n_peak : int
        The mode of the bulk histogram. Indicates the cut-off for P_unocc.
    dG : float
        The binding affinity of the lipid for the Site, in kcal/mol.
    dG_std : float
        The standard deviation of the mean binding affinity for the \
        SymmetricSites and/or Sites that comprise this Site_Across_Replicas.
